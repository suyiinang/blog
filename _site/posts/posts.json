This inconsistency hinders cross referencing between commentary and table.\r\nKeep both consistent. Age bands must match for both chart and commentary.\r\n3\r\nAxis title not properly labelled – ‘Per Cent’ was labelled below the chart title, but not on the y axis. Age band not labelled on x-axis. Not labelling leaves room for misinterpretation and/or requires reader’s extra time to peruse the chart, all of which draws attention away from the main message.\r\nIt would be clearer and more quickly understood to the reader if both the y-axis and figures were appropriately labelled.\r\n2.2 Aesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nCritiques\r\nComments\r\n4\r\nChart title’s font size and location - title of the chart should precede the commentary so that the reader is mentally prepared going into the more detailed commentary. Font size of title should be bigger than the commentary.\r\nMove title of chart above and commentary below.\r\n5\r\nCommentary is too long – the reader has to read through the whole paragraph to understand the main idea of the visualisation.\r\nShortened commentary to only the key message. Highlight by using colour, bold or underline key takeaways.\r\n6\r\nLine chart may not be the most appropriate chart – From the chart, the reader can clearly see that there is an increase in percentage for those 55+, but the reader has to cross reference to the table below to get an idea of how much it declined by. Furthermore, it is difficult to see which age band increased/decreased the most.\r\nGiven that the main message is to highlight the significant increase and decrease in share of labour by the respective age groups, leading to the increase in median age, a more appropriate graph would be a stacked bar chart.\r\n7\r\nFigures in table are redundant- It is redundant to include all the figures in the table – why make the chart in the first place if one need to reads all the numbers in the table to understanding it.\r\nRemove table – only showcase key figures to drive the main idea.\r\n8\r\nMedian age label clutters- too long, distracting and clutters the graph.\r\nRemove label. Since there are only two text, include these figures into the commentary.\r\n9\r\nThe heavy shading of the table competes for attention. The table is meant to support the main message hence shading should be kept minimal.Furthermore, the monotone shading does not add value (unlike a heat map which showcases the increase/decrease trends in values).\r\nRemove shading. Colour should always be intentional - use shading only to highlight key figures.\r\n10\r\nDifferent alignments for source and notes make the whole visualisation look disorganised.\r\nAlign these two either to the left or right to establish sense of unity and cohesion.\r\n3) Proposed Design\r\n3.1 Sketch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Sketch of proposed design\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.2 Advantages of proposed design\r\nClear title – shows how the participation rate and distribution of Singapore’s labour force has shifted by age bands from 2009 to 2019.\r\nChart titles tell the big picture story, followed up with short commentary to provide more context.\r\nShows how labour force has changed across the 10 years instead of 2 year points as shown in the original visualisation.\r\nFigures and age bands per commentary and chart are consistent for easy cross referencing.\r\nAxis are properly labeled – LFPR% and share of labour force.\r\nOnly selected figures (2009 and 2019) are shown to highlight the shift.\r\nColours are consistent throughout the dashboard.\r\n4) Data visualisation steps\r\nIn remaking the existing visualisation, I used\r\ni) Table 5 (Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex, 2009 - 2019), and\r\nii) Table 7 (Resident Labour Force Aged Fifteen Years and Over by Age and Sex, 2009 - 2019)\r\nfrom the Ministry of Manpower of Singapore.\r\n4.1 Data preparation\r\nData: Table 5 - LFPR\r\nRemove unnecessary columns\r\nDelete columns A, B, D, F, H, J, L, M, N, P, R, T, V, X, Z.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Remove unnecessary columns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemove empty rows\r\nDelete rows 1 to 4 and 19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Remove empty rows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRename header\r\nRename header from “Age (Years)” to “Age band”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Rename header\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDelete unnecessary tabs Remove tabs T5_F and T5_M. Save and rename file as T5_T_clean.\r\nData: Table 7 - Labour force 1) Tidy data Repeat steps 1 to 4 as done for Table 5 above.\r\nPivot data Import file into Tableau, select all the years, right click and select “Pivot”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Pivot data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRename headers\r\nRename ‘Pivot Field Names’ to ‘Year’. Rename ‘Pivot Field Values’ to ‘Labour force’.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Rename headers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChange data type Change Year data type to “Date”.\r\nExport file to csv Save file as “T7_T_pivot”.\r\n4.2 Data visualisation\r\nImport both T5_T_clean and T7_T_pivot into Tableau.\r\nData source tab - T5_T_clean 1) Import into Tableau & create flat file Inspect imported data: Upon importation, the LFPR from 2009 to 2019 are spread across multiple columns. As such, we want to create a flat file - select the columns from 2009 to 2019, right click and select pivot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Create flat file\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRename headers\r\nRename ‘Pivot Field Names’ to ‘Year’.\r\nRename ‘Pivot Field Values’ to ‘LFPR%’.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9: Rename header\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChange data type Change ‘Year’ data type from string to Date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 10: Change data type\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImport T7_T_pivot Inspect imported data to ensure data is in flat file format and data types are correct.\r\nLFPR% tab 1) Create line chart Drag [Year] and [LFPR%] to Columns and Rows respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 11: Create line chart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApply filter Drag [Age band] to Filters panel, and check these 4 values: 15- 24, 25-54, 55-64, 65+.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 12: Apply filter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApply colour\r\nDrag [Age band] to colour, change colours according to figure 13.\r\nUpdate ‘Automatic’ to ‘Line’.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 13: Apply colour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate view\r\nUpdate view from ‘Standard’ to ‘Entire View’.\r\nAdd annotation I only want to highlight points on 2009 and 2019.

While younger workers (15 – 24 and 25 – 54) experienced a slight increase of 3.6ppt and 3.3ppt since 2009, the increase in older workers’ (55-64 and 65) participation was triple that of younger workers, increasing by 9ppt and 11.6ppt since 2009.\r\nParticipation rate of 15 -24 workers tend to fluctuate more than the other age bands.\r\nLFPR for older workers (55-64 and 65) seemed to have experienced a steep increase in 2011.\r\nThe shift in labour force’s distribution is mainly due to shift from the 25-54 age band to the 55-64 and 65+ age band. While the share of labour force for the 15 -24 age band was quite stable (8-9%) across the 10 years.\r\nGiven that the financial crisis happened in 2008/2009, 2009 may not give the best numbers to use as a base comparison as is it historically lower compared to other years. As such, the increase in participation of old workers may be due to workers re-joining the workforce as the economy recovers, of which leads to the shift in the share of labour force towards older workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
