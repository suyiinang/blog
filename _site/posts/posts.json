Source: MOM\r\n- Share of residents refers to the age distribution of the labour force.\r\nBefore making over the selected visualisation, it is important to have a clear understanding of the context of the visualisation and its key takeaways which are dependent on:\r\n- Who: Individuals, businesses and primarily policy-makers, to help improve the well-being and optimisation of workers.\r\n- What: Understanding the shift in Singapore’s labour force from the respective age bands over the past 10 years (2009 to 2019).\r\n- How: Showing that labour force distribution and participation rate of older workers (55 and over) has increased, which resulted in the increase in labour force’s median age.\r\n2) Critiques and suggestions for current visualisation\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\n\r\nS/N\r\nCritiques\r\nComments\r\n1\r\nChart title is not precise – The title “Resident labour force by age” does not drive the message of “the increase in median age of labour force”. The chart refers to the share of labour force and is accompanied by a rather convoluted commentary on labour force participation rate (LFPR) of the different age bands and share of resident’s labour force, making it difficult to grasp the main message quickly.\r\nChange title to “The shift in Singapore’s labour force distribution and participation rate by age from 2009 to 2019”.\r\n2\r\nFigures per commentary and chart are inconsistent - The commentary quoted percentages that are aggregates of several age bands (i.e 25 to 54), while the chart uses 5-year intervals (i.e 25 to 29, 30 to 34, etc). This inconsistency hinders cross referencing between the commentary and the table.\r\nKeep both consistent. Age bands must match for both chart and commentary.\r\n3\r\nAxis title not properly labeled – ‘Share of labour force’ was not labeled on the y axis. This leaves room for misinterpretation and/or requires the reader’s extra time to peruse the chart, all of which draws attention away from the main message.\r\nIt would be clearer and more quickly understood to the reader if both the y-axis was appropriately labeled.\r\n\r\n2.2 Aesthetics\r\n\r\nS/N\r\nCritiques\r\nComments\r\n4\r\nChart title’s font size and location - title of the chart should precede the commentary so that the reader is mentally prepared going into the more detailed commentary. Font size of title should be bigger than the commentary.\r\nMove title of chart above and commentary below.\r\n5\r\nCommentary is too long – the reader has to read through the whole paragraph to understand the main idea of the visualisation.\r\nShorten commentary to only the key message. Highlight by using colour, bold or underline key takeaways.\r\n6\r\nLine chart may not be the most appropriate chart – From the chart, the reader can clearly see that there is an increase in percentage for those 55+, but the reader has to cross reference to the table below to get an idea of how much it declined by. Furthermore, it is difficult to see which age band increased/decreased the most.\r\nGiven that the main message is to highlight the significant increase and decrease in share of labour by the respective age groups, leading to the increase in median age, a more appropriate graph would be a stacked bar chart.\r\n7\r\nFigures in table are redundant- It is redundant to include all the figures in the table – why make the chart in the first place if one need to reads all the numbers in the table to understanding it.\r\nRemove table – only showcase key figures to drive the main idea.\r\n8\r\nMedian age label clutters- too long, distracting and clutters the graph.\r\nRemove median age label. Since there are only two text, include these figures into the commentary.\r\n9\r\nThe heavy shading of the table competes for attention. The table is meant to support the main message hence shading should be kept minimal. Furthermore, the monotone shading does not add value (unlike a heat map which showcases the increase/decrease trends in values).\r\nRemove shading. Colour should always be intentional - use shading only to highlight key figures.\r\n10\r\nDifferent alignments for source and notes make the whole visualisation look disorganised.\r\nAlign these two either to the left or right to establish sense of unity and cohesion.\r\n\r\n3) Proposed Design\r\n3.1 Sketch\r\nFigure 2: Sketch of proposed design\r\n3.2 Advantages of proposed design\r\nClear title – shows how the participation rate and distribution of Singapore’s labour force has shifted by age bands from 2009 to 2019.\r\nChart titles tell the big picture story, followed up with short commentary to provide more context.\r\nShows how labour force has changed across the 10 years instead of 2 year points as shown in the original visualisation.\r\nFigures and age bands per commentary and chart are consistent for easy cross referencing.\r\nAxis are properly labeled – LFPR% and share of labour force.\r\nOnly selected figures (2009 and 2019) are shown to highlight the shift.\r\nColours are consistent throughout the dashboard.\r\n4) Data visualisation steps\r\nIn remaking the existing visualisation, I used\r\ni) Table 5 (Resident Labour Force Participation Rate by Age and Sex, 2009 - 2019), and\r\nii) Table 7 (Resident Labour Force Aged Fifteen Years and Over by Age and Sex, 2009 - 2019)\r\nfrom the Ministry of Manpower of Singapore.\r\n4.1 Data preparation\r\nData: Table 5 - LFPR\r\nRemove unnecessary columns\r\nDelete columns A, B, D, F, H, J, L, M, N, P, R, T, V, X, Z.Figure 3: Remove unnecessary columns\r\nRemove empty rows\r\nDelete rows 1 to 4 and 19.

As such, we want to create a flat file - select the columns from 2009 to 2019, right click and select pivot.

This shift is due to multitude of reasons, namely aging population due to low birth rates, extended retirement age, longer average lifespan, etc.”\r\nAdd sheets\r\nAdd sheet “LFPR%” to the left and “Share of LF” to the right.

While younger workers (15 – 24 and 25 – 54) experienced a slight increase of 3.6ppt and 3.3ppt since 2009, the increase in older workers’ (55-64 and 65) participation was triple that of younger workers, increasing by 9ppt and 11.6ppt since 2009.\r\nParticipation rate of 15 - 24 workers tended to fluctuate more than the other age bands.\r\nLFPR for older workers (55-64 and 65) seemed to have experienced a steep increase in 2011.\r\nThe shift in labour force’s distribution was mainly due to shift from the 25-54 age band to the 55-64 and 65+ age band. While the share of labour force for the 15 -24 age band was quite stable (share of 8-9%) across the 10 years.\r\nGiven that the financial crisis happened in 2008/2009, 2009 may not give the best numbers to use as a base comparison as is it historically lower compared to other years. As such, the increase in participation of old workers may be due to workers re-joining the workforce as the economy recovers, of which leads to the shift in the share of labour force towards older workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
